This would involve replacing Hangfire with AWS Lambda for serverless background processing and substituting in-memory queuing with Amazon SQS or SNS for a more scalable and reliable queueing mechanism. This approach would not only align with cloud-native best practices but also offer better scalability and maintenance benefits in the long run.</p>"},{"location":"questions/","title":"Mock Interview Questions for CapTech Consulting","text":""},{"location":"questions/#challenging-project","title":"Challenging Project","text":"<ul> <li>Highlight: Migrated TIBCO BusinessWorks to .NET 6+ APIs, focusing on Kerberos authentication in a Kubernetes/AWS environment.</li> <li>Specific Example: Led the configuration of Kerberos authentication, coordinated team efforts, and ensured smooth transition to the new system.</li> <li>Key Takeaway: Demonstrates leadership in technical coordination and problem-solving under pressure.</li> </ul>"},{"location":"questions/#handling-tight-deadlines","title":"Handling Tight Deadlines","text":"<ul> <li>Highlight: Effective time management and communication.</li> <li>Specific Example: Managed the Fast Dashboard project, prioritizing tasks and maintaining team cohesion to meet tight deadlines.</li> <li>Key Takeaway: Proven ability to stay organized and meet deadlines while maintaining team cohesion.</li> </ul>"},{"location":"questions/#recent-technical-problem","title":"Recent Technical Problem","text":"<ul> <li>Highlight: Developed .NET libraries (LPL Commons) for logging and caching.</li> <li>Specific Example: Created libraries for logging to ELK in ECS format and interfaces for caching with Redis, DynamoDB, and S3.</li> <li>Key Takeaway: Shows expertise in .NET, problem-solving skills, and ability to enhance system efficiency.</li> </ul>"},{"location":"questions/#working-with-difficult-team-members","title":"Working with Difficult Team Members","text":"<ul> <li>Highlight: Emphasizes communication and conflict resolution.</li> <li>Specific Example: Managed conflicts within the Fast Dashboard team, fostering a collaborative environment.</li> <li>Key Takeaway: Strong interpersonal skills and leadership in diverse team environments.</li> </ul>"},{"location":"questions/#staying-current-with-industry-trends","title":"Staying Current with Industry Trends","text":"<ul> <li>Highlight: Continuous learning through industry publications, courses, and networks.</li> <li>Specific Example: Regularly participated in online courses and professional networks, applying new knowledge to improve project outcomes.</li> <li>Key Takeaway: Commitment to professional development and applying new knowledge effectively.</li> </ul>"},{"location":"questions/#client-management-approach","title":"Client Management Approach","text":"<ul> <li>Highlight: Understanding needs, open communication, and managing expectations.</li> <li>Specific Example: Successfully managed client relationships in the Fast Dashboard project by maintaining open lines of communication and clear expectations.</li> <li>Key Takeaway: Client-focused mindset and ability to deliver value through strong relationships.</li> </ul>"},{"location":"questions/#improving-processes-or-systems","title":"Improving Processes or Systems","text":"<ul> <li>Highlight: Implementing background processing and queuing with Hangfire in the Fast Dashboard project.</li> <li>Specific Example: Developed an orchestration layer for mergers and acquisitions, improving system performance and reliability.</li> <li>Key Takeaway: Analytical skills and initiative in driving positive change and improving system reliability.</li> </ul>"},{"location":"questions/#prioritizing-work-across-multiple-projects","title":"Prioritizing Work Across Multiple Projects","text":"<ul> <li>Highlight: Framework for assessing deadlines, importance, and resources.</li> <li>Specific Example: Utilized prioritization strategies to manage multiple high-priority projects concurrently, ensuring timely delivery and quality.</li> <li>Key Takeaway: Effective multitasking and organizational skills to deliver quality work.</li> </ul>"},{"location":"questions/#interest-in-captech","title":"Interest in CapTech","text":"<ul> <li>Highlight: Attracted by company culture, projects, and reputation.
